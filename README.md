# &#9762; my app starter &#9762;

my starter repo for an app. don't worry this will all be irrelevant in seven
months anyway.

## before you do anything

    npm install # or even `npm isntall`

## start the dev server

    npm run dev

## build into the `./dist` directory

    npm run build

## check the size of the minified, gzip'd output

    npm run build-stats
